# Gender Equality Plan  
**AI4REASON z.ú.**  
**Period: 2025–2028**

## 1. Introduction  
AI4REASON z.ú. is a non-profit research institute committed to fostering an inclusive and fair environment. As part of our institutional development, we acknowledge the importance of gender equality as a core value in line with the principles of Horizon Europe.

This Gender Equality Plan (GEP) outlines our general commitment and strategic orientation regarding gender equality. It is publicly available on our website and will be reviewed periodically as the institute grows.

## 2. Institutional Commitment  
AI4REASON z.ú. endorses the European Commission’s framework for gender equality and aims to progressively align its internal practices with best standards in this area. We support an organisational culture that promotes equal opportunities, transparency, and non-discrimination across all activities.

## 3. Strategic Areas  
As the institute develops, the following areas will be addressed through proportionate policies and procedures:
- Work-life balance and organisational culture
- Gender balance in leadership and decision-making
- Gender equality in recruitment and career progression
- Integration of gender dimension in research content
- Measures against gender-based violence, including sexual harassment

## 4. Governance and Monitoring  
At this early stage, AI4REASON z.ú. does not employ permanent staff. The director of the institute will oversee the future development and implementation of internal equality measures.

As staffing and activities increase, the institute will establish mechanisms for:
- Monitoring gender balance in staffing and governance
- Providing training on gender awareness
- Reviewing recruitment and management procedures
- Updating this plan accordingly

## 5. Resources  
As appropriate to its size and stage of development, AI4REASON z.ú. will allocate adequate resources (time, attention, and responsibility) to ensure gradual implementation of gender equality objectives.
